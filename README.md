# Text Improvement Engine

## Overview
This tool analyzes input text and suggests improvements based on similarity to a list of standardized phrases.

## Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the script via the CLI or start the Streamlit app with `streamlit run app.py`.

## Usage
- **CLI**: `python text_improvement.py input.txt`
- **Web Interface**: Open in a browser and paste your text.

## Results Analysis
The tool performed well on straightforward text but struggled with more complex sentences. Given more time, I would consider training a custom model or improving the pre-processing steps to better handle diverse inputs.
